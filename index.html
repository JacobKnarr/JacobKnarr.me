    <h2> University of Guelph Computer Science undergrad, minoring in Mathematics </h2>
    
    <p class="intro"> Over the last few years of my Computer Science degree I have come to learn quite a lot about the software industry. <br>
      Focusing on languages like C, Java, Python, PHP, HTML and more, I have found many solutions to problems I never thought possible. <br> 
      I look forward to learning more every day so I can use my knowledge to help others. </p>
